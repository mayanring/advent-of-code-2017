# Advent of Code 2017

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2017.

It was mildly annoying to have part two revealed only after finishing part one, and then realizing it has similar yet different requirements.
Since this is for fun, I just re-pasted the code from part one and adapted it to meet the needs of part two rather than
parameterizing the code to be able to run both requirements.
